# Portfolio Project - My Personal Blog

As a self-taught software developer passionate about health and fitness, I combined my skills to create adiravraham.com, a dynamic fitness blog designed and developed from scratch.

Leveraging my expertise in front-end development, **I planned, designed, and built the website from scratch** using React, Astro, and TailwindCSS.
Additionally, I integrated essential features like an email management system with Resend and utilized AstroDB for newsletter storage. 

While my primary focus was on development, I also write articles covering workout routines, nutrition, and healthy lifestyle habits. Each article informs, inspires, and empowers readers on their fitness journey.

## Key Features:

- **Custom Design and Development:** planned, designed, and developed every aspect of the website using React, Astro, and TailwindCSS for a seamless user experience and visually stunning interface.

- **Email Management System Integration:** Efficiently manage subscriber engagement with an email management system using **Resend**, delivering regular newsletters, exclusive content, and updates directly to subscribers' inboxes.

- **Newsletter User Storage with AstroDB:** Securely store subscriber information and manage newsletter distribution using AstroDB and Resend.

- **Local Storage:** Implemented client-side rendering (CSR) with Local Storage to manage and display blog posts dynamically.
