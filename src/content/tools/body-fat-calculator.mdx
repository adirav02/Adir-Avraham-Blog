- **Athletes**: Athletes usually have a body fat percentage of 14-20% for women and 6-13% for men, reflecting higher muscle mass and lower fat.
- **Fitness**: For individuals who exercise regularly but are not athletes, a healthy range is 21-24% for women and 14-17% for men.
- **Average**: The average body fat percentage is around 25-31% for women and 18-24% for men.
- **Obese**: A body fat percentage over 32% for women and over 25% for men is considered obese.

## Recommendations Based on Your Body Fat Percentage

- **High Body Fat**: Focus on a balanced diet and regular exercise. Incorporate both cardio and strength training to reduce body fat.
- **Moderate Body Fat**: Maintain your current routine but consider fine-tuning your diet and exercise for improved results.
