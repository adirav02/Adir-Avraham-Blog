const html = "<p>We have all been there, hitting the treadmill for miles, spending hours on the elliptical trainer, sweating it out, convinced this is the only way to lose those extra pounds. Weeks of grinding cardio yielded little progress and frustration after checking the scale.</p>\n<p>But hold on! Shedding those unwanted pounds doesn’t have to be a marathon of endless cardio. Here, I’m going to unveil a treasure trove of alternative ways to supercharge your fat loss journey.</p>\n<p>Before we dive into the tactics, let’s explore and understand how fat is created.</p>\n<h1 id=\"fat\">Fat</h1>\n<h2 id=\"calories\">Calories</h2>\n<p>Calorie is a measurement of the energy content of food. The body needs calories to perform its functions, such as breathing, blood circulation, and physical activity.<br>\nYou gain calories by eating food.</p>\n<h2 id=\"how-fat-is-created\">How Fat Is Created?</h2>\n<p>Fat is created by an excess of calories, when you eat too many calories each day, the excess calories have to go somewhere. Your body stores these calories by turning them into body fat.</p>\n<h2 id=\"how-does-fat-burn\">How does Fat burn?</h2>\n<p>Fat loss happens when your body burns more calories than it consumes.</p>\n<p>Now, after we understand how our bodies gain weight and fat, it’s time to understand what cardio is and how it might help us lose weight.</p>\n<h1 id=\"cardio\">Cardio</h1>\n<h2 id=\"what-is-cardio-exercise\">What is Cardio Exercise?</h2>\n<p>Cardio exercise, sometimes called aerobic or endurance exercise, is any rhythmic activity that raises your heart rate to a target heart rate zone.</p>\n<p>During the activity, oxygen is heavily involved in the cellular reactions that produce the energy necessary to sustain the activity. As a result, your heart rate and breathing increase.</p>\n<p>Imagine your body’s like a giant phone. It needs power (energy) to work out, right? During exercise, your body uses oxygen (like the charger) to fuel tiny reactions inside your cells (like the phone’s battery). These reactions give your muscles the energy they need to keep going!</p>\n<h2 id=\"examples-of-cardio-exercises\">Examples of Cardio Exercises</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Running</li>\n<li>Elliptical</li>\n<li>Jumping jacks</li>\n<li>Swimming</li>\n<li>Walking</li>\n<li>Cycling</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"how-can-cardio-help-you-burn-fat\">How Can Cardio Help You Burn Fat?</h2>\n<p>Cardio is great for fat loss because raising your heart rate means your body uses more energy and burns calories faster.</p>\n<p>To get the most out of cardio, use intense exercises that target large muscle groups. The harder your muscles work, they will use more oxygen in your blood, resulting in a higher heart rate, and that’s what burns calories.</p>\n<p>Why do you get winded faster while sprinting than taking a casual walk? It’s because your body needs a massive energy boost to keep up with the intense activity. All that extra energy comes from burning calories. So, sprinting burns calories quicker than walking because your body is working much harder.</p>\n<h1 id=\"is-it-necessary-to-do-a-lot-of-cardio\">Is it Necessary To Do a Lot of Cardio?</h1>\n<p>Your body loses fat when the daily calorie intake is lower than how many calories your body burns.</p>\n<p>We often think exercise is the only key to weight loss. Your body doesn’t care if those 1,000 calories burned come from exercise, or you eating a lighter lunch.</p>\n<p>It’s all about creating a calorie deficit - burning more calories than you consume.</p>\n<h1 id=\"how-to-lose-fat-without-cardio\">How to Lose Fat without cardio</h1>\n<p>Your body burns a certain number of calories each day. The key to fat loss lies in understanding this number and creating a calorie deficit.</p>\n<p>But how do you figure out your body’s unique calorie burn? Let’s crack the code! Head over to our dedicated calorie calculator to reveal your daily burn rate.</p>\n<h2 id=\"nutrition\">Nutrition</h2>\n<p>Eating fewer calories than your body burns daily results in fat loss. But, how do we eat less food without sacrificing energy levels and staying hungry?</p>\n<h3 id=\"eating-less-dense-calories\">Eating Less Dense Calories</h3>\n<p>It’s that dreaded 3:00 pm slump. Your stomach growls, your eyes glaze over, and suddenly, the candy aisle beckons. A sugary Kit-Kat whispering your name, promising a much-needed burst of energy and pure chocolatey bliss. But hold on! before you reach for that KitKat bar, consider this: it packs a whopping 218 calories! Three of those could leave you hungry AND regretting it later.</p>\n<p>Now, let’s talk about a guilt-free powerhouse: The humble cucumber. A whole cap of this refreshing veggie clocks in at a mere 16 calories. You can make a giant, delicious salad for less the cost than a single Kit-Kat!</p>\n<h3 id=\"keep-high-protein-impact\">Keep High Protein Impact</h3>\n<p>When you are in a calorie deficit,  your body might start breaking down muscle tissue for energy, and you can lose muscle mass.</p>\n<p>By keeping your protein intake high during a calorie deficit, you can help your body preserve precious muscle mass. Protein is the building block of muscle, and a steady supply ensures your body uses fat stores for energy instead.  This helps you healthily lose weight while keeping that toned physique you’re working hard for.</p>\n<h2 id=\"training\">Training</h2>\n<h3 id=\"short-breaks-more-volume-weightlifting-for-cardio-results\">Short Breaks, More Volume: Weightlifting for Cardio Results!</h3>\n<p>Ditch the Long Rest Periods: By shortening your breaks between sets, you can keep your heart rate up and your body working harder. This mimics the effects of a cardio session.</p>\n<p>Pump Up the Volume: Doing more reps per set with lighter weights increases your heart rate and challenges your muscles differently.</p>\n<p>This approach is often called <em>Density Training</em>. It helps you burn more calories, build muscle, and save time in one workout!</p>\n<h3 id=\"add-more-compound-exercises\">Add More Compound Exercises</h3>\n<p>Compound exercises work on multiple muscle groups at once, creating a high-energy firestorm in your body. This translates to more calories burned during your workout. So ditch the bicep curls and embrace exercises like squats, lunges, and rows.</p>\n<h1 id=\"full-body-fat-burning-circuit-workout-you-can-do-everywhere\">Full Body Fat Burning Circuit Workout You Can Do Everywhere</h1>\n<p>This full-body circuit workout is your ticket to serious calorie burning, no matter where you are.</p>\n<p>These bodyweight exercises use multiple muscle groups, leading to a greater metabolic boost.\r\nYou can do as many circuits as you would like, and rest for 1 minute when completed.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<table><thead><tr><th>Exercise</th><th>Reps**</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Jump Squats</td><td>10</td></tr><tr><td>Jumping Lunges*</td><td>10</td></tr><tr><td>Pull-ups</td><td>10</td></tr><tr><td>Reverse Grip Pull-ups</td><td>10</td></tr><tr><td>Dips</td><td>10</td></tr><tr><td>Chair Dips</td><td>10</td></tr><tr><td>Push-ups</td><td>10</td></tr><tr><td>Bumprees</td><td>10</td></tr><tr><td>Crunch Twist</td><td>10</td></tr></tbody></table>\n<p>*Reps Per side</p>\n<p>**This is YOUR workout!
