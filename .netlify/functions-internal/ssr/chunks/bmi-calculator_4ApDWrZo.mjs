The formula is BMI = kg/m² where kg is a person's weight in kilograms and m² is their height in meters squared. A BMI between 18.5 and 24.9 is considered normal, while a BMI below 18.5 is considered underweight, and a BMI of 25 or above is considered overweight or obese.\r\n\r\n## How to Calculate Your BMI\r\n\r\nCalculating your BMI can give you a general idea of whether you're underweight, normal weight, overweight, or obese. However, it doesn't measure body fat directly. Therefore, it’s important to consider other factors like muscle mass, bone density, and overall body composition when interpreting your BMI.\r\n\r\nBelow, you can use our simple BMI calculator to find out your BMI. Just enter your weight and height, and select the unit of measurement.\r\n\r\n<BMICalculator client:load />\r\n\r\n## BMI Categories and Their Implications\r\n\r\nYour BMI falls into one of several categories, each of which has different implications for your health:\r\n\r\n- **Underweight (BMI < 18.5)**: Being underweight can be a sign of malnutrition, underlying disease, or other health issues. It’s advisable to consult with a healthcare provider to determine the cause and appropriate steps.\r\n- **Normal weight (BMI 18.5 - 24.9)**: This range is considered healthy for most people. Maintaining this weight can help reduce the risk of developing serious health conditions.\r\n- **Overweight (BMI 25 - 29.9)**: Being overweight increases the risk of cardiovascular diseases, type 2 diabetes, and other health issues. Lifestyle changes, such as improved diet and increased physical activity, can help manage weight.\r\n- **Obese (BMI ≥ 30)**: Obesity significantly increases the risk of serious health conditions, including heart disease, diabetes, and certain cancers. It’s important to seek medical advice to create a weight loss plan that includes diet, exercise, and possibly medical interventions.\r\n\r\n## Recommendations Based on Your BMI\r\n\r\n- **Underweight**: Consider gaining weight through a balanced diet that includes nutritious, calorie-dense foods. Strength training exercises can help build muscle mass.\r\n- **Normal weight**: Maintain your healthy weight by continuing to eat a balanced diet and engaging in regular physical activity.\r\n- **Overweight**: Aim to lose weight by making dietary changes, increasing physical activity, and possibly seeking guidance from a healthcare provider.\r\n- **Obese**: Consult with a healthcare provider to develop a comprehensive weight loss plan that includes dietary changes, increased physical activity, and possibly medical treatments.\r\n\r\n## Conclusion\r\n\r\nBMI is a useful screening tool to understand your weight category and its potential impact on your health. However, it should be used as part of a broader assessment of your overall health. Always consult with healthcare professionals for personalized health advice.\r\n";
