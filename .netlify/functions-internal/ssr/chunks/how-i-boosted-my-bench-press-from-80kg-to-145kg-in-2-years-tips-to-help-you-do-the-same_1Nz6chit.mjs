I often hear from folks in my gym who are stuck progressing in the Bench Press and wonder how I keep setting higher PRs very frequently.\r\n\r\nIf you are here, you are probably curious about my secret.\r\n\r\nWell, here it is.\r\n\r\n## The Bench Press\r\n\r\nBefore diving in, let's briefly discuss the Bench Press, one of the 'Big 3' exercises. It's fundamental for building a bigger chest and overall strength. You lie on a bench, pick up a barbell, lower it to your chest, and press it back up. This exercise mainly targets the pecs, shoulders, and triceps.\r\n\r\n## Learning the Technique\r\n\r\nDespite being straightforward, many people get the Bench Press wrong. Common mistakes include poor foot positioning, improper grip width causing unwanted stress over the joints, short eccentric motion, and lack of arching in the back.\r\n\r\n### Set-up\r\n\r\n1. Lie on the bench and position your feet 90° or less to your knees while pressing the floor with your toes.\r\n2. Raise your chest and create an arch in your back (your lower back shouldn’t touch the bench) while pressing your upper back and rear shoulders against the bench.\r\n\r\n### Lifting The Bar\r\n\r\n1. Hold the bar slightly wider from your shoulder width (or shoulder width if uncomfortable)\r\n2. Focus on a point at the ceiling instead of the bar\r\n3. Take a deep breath and hold the air in your belly before lifting the bar.\r\n4. Lift the bar and lock your elbows, bringing it to the point you are focused on. Getting a lift-off from a spotter is helpful to save energy for the pressing.\r\n\r\n### Getting The Reps\r\n\r\n1. Lower the bar to your chest at the nipple line and press it back up to the starting point.\r\n\r\n**Important notes**\r\n\r\n- Don't look at the bar! Always stay in the focus zone you found during the setup phase. Get the bar back there.\r\n- Take your shoulders back and flex your abs to gain more control over the weight.\r\n- Push the floor with your feet like when you do calf presses.\r\n- Keep elbows at a 45° angle, to reduce shoulders pressure and the risk of injuries.\r\n- Exhale after completing the rep, or during the concentric motion. I find more power in keeping air for 2-3 reps before breathing again.\r\n- Lock your arms after finishing a rep before you continue to do another one.\r\n\r\n## Supporting Exercises\r\n\r\nThe chest is the main working muscle in the bench press. However, shoulders and triceps also work when we press, these are 'supportive muscles'. You can enhance these muscles to lift more on the bench.\r\n\r\n### Shoulder Press\r\n\r\nThe Shoulder Press is a pressing exercise, similar to the Bench Press. But, it mainly works on the shoulders.

I highly recommend you add this exercise to your triceps workouts.\r\n\r\n## Putting This In Practice\r\n\r\nI prioritize these exercises at the start of my workouts:\r\n\r\n- Bench Press on chest days\r\n- Shoulder Press on shoulder days\r\n- Triceps Extension on triceps days\r\n\r\nYou can do Shoulder Press and Triceps Extension in the middle of the workout (depending on your split).
